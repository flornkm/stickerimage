# Open Source Laptop Sticker Maker

Hi, this is Flo. This was a little project I shared on X, initially just as a design post. Many people wanted it, so I've built it. Hope you have fun using it. It took way longer than expected and I'm super exhausted the time I'm writing this.

I would be incredibly happy if you share your custom stickers with me on Twitter [@flornkm](https://twitter.com/flornkm). It would also be great to get a Star here on GitHub.
